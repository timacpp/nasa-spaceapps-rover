# Rover: the game

This is an **unfinished** game developed for NASA Spaceapps 2021, a worldwide hackathon.
The idea is to travel beyond the space limits in search of habitable planets.
But that's not all: the main character is my weiner dog, unironically named Rover.

# Results
Our team got **second** place in local Cambridge judgement and we were included in top 15% among participants all around the world.
